In the provided code there are two possible modes to choose the parameters for LSH:
MODE = {choose_bands, choose_rows}
In the first mode you can select the number of bands (b) for LSH and the number of rows per band will be chosen accordingly
In the second mode you can select the number of rows per band for LSH and the number of bands will be chosen accordingly
In both cases the missing parameter will be chosen taking into account the threshold estimation formula (provided in the textbook):
s = (1/b) ^ (1/r)
With s = 0.8 (as requested) and b or r having the inserted parameter according to the selected mode.
The length of the signature will of course be n = r*b.
Choose r and b properly (especially, don't exaggerate with r in choose_rows mode), as I didn't bound huge values of n.

r,b plotted values calculated from the script
